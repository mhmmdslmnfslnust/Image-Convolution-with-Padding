# üõ†Ô∏è Improvement Plan for Convolution Project

This document outlines a prioritized roadmap of potential improvements for the convolution simulation project. The goal is to iteratively enhance flexibility, performance, and usability without overwhelming the codebase in a single update.

---

## üî¥ High Priority (Immediate Impact)

These improvements will have the most noticeable effect on usability and versatility and should be addressed first.

### 1. Make Matrix Sizes Configurable
- Allow dynamic input of image and kernel sizes.
- Improves generalization beyond fixed 6x6 image and 3x3 kernel.

### 2. Add Input Validation
- Sanitize and validate user input (e.g., prevent negative dimensions).
- Ensure stable and predictable program behavior.

### 3. Add More Kernel Options
- Include a selection of common predefined kernels:
  - Edge Detection
  - Gaussian Blur
  - Sharpening
- Allow users to select a kernel via input.

### 4. Normalize Output
- Scale convolution results to a defined range (e.g., 0‚Äì255).
- Prevent overflow or underflow in displayed results.

## üü° Medium Priority (Enhance Functionality)

These features improve experience and performance but are not critical to core function.

### 5. Implement Different Padding Strategies
- Add support for:
  - Zero Padding (default)
  - Replicate Padding
  - Reflect Padding

### 6. Optimize Convolution Operation
- Refactor the convolution loop for efficiency.
- Optionally use multithreading for performance gains on larger matrices.

### 7. Add Visualization of Results
- Display results using ASCII art or via OpenCV.
- Helps with debugging and understanding the output visually.

---

## üîµ Low Priority (Advanced Features)

These are more complex or niche features and can be planned after the core system is stabilized.

### 8. Add Support for Image File Input
- Load grayscale images from external files.
- Replace randomly generated matrices with actual data.

### 9. Add Multi-Channel (Color) Image Support
- Extend convolution to handle RGB (3-channel) images.
- Requires handling and combining separate channel results.

### 10. Implement Boundary Handling Options
- Provide users with choices for managing kernel overflow at image borders.

### 11. Add Benchmarking Capabilities
- Measure and report execution time of convolution.
- Useful for performance tuning and profiling.
